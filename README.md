# html_css_slider
Pure HTML and CSS slider. Fully Responsive. Not mine - I got this off Youtube, but it works perfectly for my style of coding.
You can place it in any container with a width setting of choice and it will always be center.
You should just note it gets very confusing by the css.... So We can actually call this like a 4-image slider because if this gets more images, things get strange.
This is something I will just use for decorative purposes, I guess I can work in some javascript to add buttons and so forth. But for now this is exactly what I want.
